Given the response from this resume checker website
all of these responses are highlighted in a very positive way
and given the format I would assume this is done using some gpt OR gemini embedding keys

Problem - Very positive responses
Its something that you could even get directly from a local chatgpt OR gemini chat with telling some additional data

Altough the area of Imporvement is relatively good and onpoint.

But its scoring very high,
even the best of best resumes should get scored with a very high standard.

Additional updates to follow
Ask for role applying for
fetch all the related keywords from resume vs fetch the bold keywords,
check if they are in relevance for the role applied

whats not in relevance and could be removed/enhanced better using same embeddings.

along with giving the area of improvements we can directly use the embeddings to create an improved version of the resume while fixing it( using some raw template and showcase to user in pop up format, in case he wanna download/customize it(it will cost/limited times only))[Additonal feature]

Also the anual salaray example given is way higher
will have to train of examplary data a lot more,

and even can use job requirement given by native companies using job portals to suggest what they are looking for and its missing/less represented in your profile
